        <p>Hello, my name is Faizan Dhankwala, and I am currently a Running Start student at Bellevue College. Before
            BC, I went to Interlake High School. When it comes to programming, I have almost zero experience in any
            language. I never was really interested in the field. Whenever I would see someone code, it looked really
            boring as well as very confusing. My entire family are very dedicated to programming as their careers. I
            live with four other siblings, I have a big brother, and one little brother as well as two little sisters.
            my dad works in Microsoft as a Senior Programmer, my brother is enrolled in the University of Washington and
            his major is Computer Science. He too, will soon go to Microsoft because he already has a reserved spot for
            him. My little brother is starting on JavaScript and Python. My two younger sisters don't really have any
            career ideas at the moment. Because of their experience. my family soon convinced me to try programming at
            least one time to see if I would grow an interest in the field. I hope I will grow an interest in
            programming and an understanding of HTML and JavaScript and overall coding in general.



            I have a cell phone and my own computer. When it comes to Artificial Intelligence at home, I have only one-
            Microsoft's Cortona Home-(not very good). I really enjoy Windows and I really don't like MAC or Linux
            because I am so used to Windows. Another reason I prefer Windows is that Microsoft gives it to me for free.
            Some hobbies that I love are playing the Trombone, video editing, Soccer, and drawing. I also enjoy hiking
            in the woods and going to the gym.</p>
