                The Ford F-150 Raptor (originally Ford SVT Raptor) is a nameplate used by two different models of pickup trucks produced by Ford (the Ford F-150 and the Ford Ranger). Drawing its name from both birds of prey and the velociraptor, the Raptor nameplate is used for the highest-performance version of the Ford F-Series (in North America) and of the Ranger (in markets where the F-Series is not sold). Introduced for the 2010 model year, two generations of the F-150 Raptor have been produced; the Ranger Raptor was introduced for the 2019 model year and for the first time the Ford Ranger will be available in USA.

                Developed as a street-legal counterpart of an off-road racing vehicle, the Raptor is optimized for off-road use, with four-wheel drive, all-terrain tires, and an upgraded suspension system. Along with widened fenders, the Raptor is visually distinguished by its grille emblem; in lieu of the Ford Blue Oval, both the F-Series and Ranger Raptor spell "FORD" in the grille (last used by Ford in 1983).

                The Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars since 2002 and now in its second generation.

                The first generation was introduced at the 2002 North American International Auto Show and used the Volvo P2 platform shared with the first generation Volvo S80 and other large Volvo cars. It was manufactured at Volvo's Torslandaverken. Volvo moved production equipment of the first generation to China and ended Swedish production at the end of 2014, renaming the car as the Volvo XC Classic (or Volvo XC90 Classic).
                
                At the end of 2014, the second generation XC90 was introduced. It is based on a new global platform, called Scalable Product Architecture or SPA for short. Both generations of the XC90 have won Motor Trend's SUV of the Year award in their debuts.

                The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called G-Wagen (short for Geländewagen, "cross country vehicle"), is a mid-size four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. In certain markets, it has been sold under the Puch name as Puch G.

                The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few vehicles to have such a feature.
                
                Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 40 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.
