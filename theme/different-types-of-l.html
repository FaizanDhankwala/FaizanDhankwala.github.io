                The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed
                by BMW. The i8 is part of BMW's electric fleet
                "Project i" being marketed as a new sub-brand, BMW
                i. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh
                lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an
                all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New
                European Driving Cycle. Under the United States
                Environmental Protection Agency cycle, the range in
                EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of
                gasoline consumption. Its design is heavily
                influenced by the BMW M1 Homage concept car, which
                in turn pays homage to BMW's last production
                mid-engined sports car prior to the i8: the BMW M1.
                BMW will cease the production of the BMW i8 in
                April 2020.

                The Audi TT is a 2-door sports car marketed by
                Volkswagen Group subsidiary Audi since 1998, and
                now in its third generation. The first two
                generations were assembled by the Audi subsidiary
                Audi Hungaria Motor Kft. in Győr, Hungary, using
                bodyshells manufactured and painted at Audi's
                Ingolstadt plant[2] and parts made entirely by the
                Hungarian factory for the third generation. For
                each of its three generations, the TT has been
                available as a 2+2 coupé and as a two-seater
                roadster employing consecutive generations of the
                Volkswagen Group A platform, starting with the A4
                (PQ34). As a result of this platform-sharing, the
                Audi TT has identical powertrain and suspension
                layouts as its related platform-mates; including a
                front-mounted transversely oriented engine,
                front-wheel drive or quattro four-wheel drive
                system, and fully independent front suspension
                using MacPherson struts.

                The Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio (Tipo M145)
                are a series of a grand tourers produced by the
                Italian automobile manufacturer Maserati. They
                succeeded the 2-door V8 grand tourers offered by
                the company, the Maserati Coupé and Spyder. The
                model was initially equipped with a 4.2-litre
                (4,244 cc (259.0 cu in)) V8 engine developed in
                conjunction with Ferrari. The engine generates a
                maximum power output of 405 PS (298 kW; 399 hp) and
                is equipped with a 6-speed ZF automatic
                transmission. The GranTurismo platform was derived
                from Maserati M139 platform of Maserati
                Quattroporte V, with double-wishbone front and rear
                suspension. The grand tourer emphasizes comfort in
                harmony with speed and driver-enjoyment.
