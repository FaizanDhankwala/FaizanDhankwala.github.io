          The Audi TT is a 2-door sports car marketed by
          Volkswagen. The first two generations were assembled by
          the Audi but then Voltswagon bought the company. The TT
          has been available as a 2x2 coupé and as a two-seater
          roadster mostly for couples-as it delivers style and it
          is small. The Audi TT has identical powertrain and
          suspension layouts as its related platform-mates sucha s
          Voltswagon cars by including a front-mounted transversely
          oriented engine, front-wheel drive or quattro four-wheel
          drive system, and fully independent front suspension
          using MacPherson struts. This is what makes it so
          powerfull, but still small.
