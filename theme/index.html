The theme will be about different types of cars and what they are
designed for. Cars have always intrested me as a child. I would
love watching them race at public races or just when a car would
speed in general. As I grew older, I started studying cars and
their parts. The three types of cars in this website are
Luxurious-cars, Sports cars, and Off Road.
