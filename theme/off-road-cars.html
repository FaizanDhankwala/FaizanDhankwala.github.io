    fourth generation. The Wrangler JL, the most recent
    generation, was unveiled in late 2017 and is produced at
    Jeep's Toledo Complex. The US military also uses both the

    their products.

        Some histroy about the Hummer H2 is that it is a large
        SUV that was marketed by Hummer and built by AM General
        in 2009. A lot of people think that the based on The
        Chevrolet Tahoe. A four-door pickup truck. This is wrong
        as both cars have different body kits and different
        specifications for the engine.
