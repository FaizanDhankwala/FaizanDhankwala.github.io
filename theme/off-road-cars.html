                The Jeep Wrangler is a series of compact and
                mid-size ( four-wheel drive off-road SUVs, manufactured by
                Jeep since 1986, and currently in its fourth
                generation. The Wrangler JL, the most recent
                generation, was unveiled in late 2017 and is
                produced at Jeep's Toledo Complex. The Wrangler is
                arguably an indirect progression from the World War
                II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian Jeeps) produced
                by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep and American Motors
                Corporation (AMC) from the mid-1940s through 1980s.
                Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after its
                purchase of AMC in 1987) have claimed that the
                Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original
                military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the
                conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid
                axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model
                as central to Jeep's brand identity as the
                rear-engined 911 is to Porsche.

                utility vehicle (SUV) from Land Rover, a marque of
                Jaguar Land Rover. The Range Rover was launched in

                 Some histroy about the Hummer H2 is that it is  a large SUV that was marketed by
                Hummer and built by AM General from 2002 to 2009
                based on a modified GMT820 Chevrolet 2500 HD in
                front and 1500 frame in back. A common
                misconception about the H2, stemming from its basis
                on the aforementioned platform, was that it was
                based purely on the Chevrolet Tahoe. A four-door
                pickup truck version with a midgate that opens the
                vehicle's interior to the external cargo bed was
                introduced for 2005 as the H2 SUT.
