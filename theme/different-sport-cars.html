                Some histroy about the The Audi R8 is that it is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,
                which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent
                all-wheel drive system. It was introduced by the
                German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. The car is
                exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured
                by Audi AG's private subsidiary company
                manufacturing high performance automotive parts,
                Audi Sport GmbH . and is
                based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the
                Huracán platform. The fundamental construction of
                the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses
                an aluminium monocoque which is built using space
                frame principles. The car is built by Audi Sport
                GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's
                'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.
