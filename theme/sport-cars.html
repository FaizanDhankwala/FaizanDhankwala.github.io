      Some histroy about the LaFerrari is based on findings from
      testing of the FXX development prototype and on research
      being conducted by the Millechili Project at the University
      of Modena. Association with the Millechili Project led to
      speculation during development that the car would weigh
      under 1,000 kg was claimed. Only 499 units were produced,
      and each cost more than 1 million US dollars.

        The Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are mid-engined
        two-seater sports cars manufactured and marketed by
        German automobile manufacturer Porsche across four
        generations — as a 2-door, 2-seater roadster and a
        3-door, 2-seater fastback coupé. The first generation
        Boxster was introduced in 1996. These cars are very
        popular for not very racing puposes but more of casual
        street.

        The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sports car
        produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer. In
        keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is
        named after a fighting bull. The max production for this
        car was supposed to be 4000, but the sales went to high,
        and Lamborghini exceeded it to 5000. It is one of the
        most high preformance cars in italy and the United
        States. Lamborghini first designed tractors(that is why
        the logo is a bull). But soon, in 1963, the first
        lamborghini production car was released.
