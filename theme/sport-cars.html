                The Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are
                mid-engined two-seater sports cars manufactured and
                marketed by German automobile manufacturer Porsche
                across four generations — as a 2-door, 2-seater
                roadster (Boxster) and a 3-door, 2-seater fastback
                coupé (Cayman). The first generation Boxster was
                introduced in 1996; the second generation Boxster
                and the Cayman arrived in late 2005; and the third
                generation launched in 2012. Since the introduction
                of the fourth generation in 2016, the two models
                have been marketed as the Porsche 718 Boxster and
                Porsche 718 Cayman.

                The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sports
                car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer
                Lamborghini. In keeping with Lamborghini tradition,
                the Aventador is named after a fighting
                bull.Production of the Aventador was planned to be
                limited to 4,000 vehicles (4,099 Murciélagos were
                built); however, in 2016, it achieved the 5,000
                unit milestone. The molds used to make the
                carbon-fibre monocoque are expected to last 500
                molds each and only 8 have been made. The base
                price of the Aventador is $393,695.
