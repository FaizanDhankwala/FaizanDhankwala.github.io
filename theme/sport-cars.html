        Some histroy about the LaFerrari is based on findings from
        testing of the FXX development prototype and on research
        being conducted by the Millechili Project at the University
        of Modena. Association with the Millechili Project led to
        speculation during development that the car would weigh
        under 1,000 kg was claimed. Only 499 units were produced,
        and each cost more than 1 million US dollars.

          The Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are mid-engined
          two-seater sports cars manufactured and marketed by
          German automobile manufacturer Porsche across four
          generations — as a 2-door, 2-seater roadster and a
          3-door, 2-seater fastback coupé. The first generation
          Boxster was introduced in 1996. These cars are very
          popular for not very racing puposes but more of casual
          street.

          The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sports car
          produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer. In
          keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is
          named after a fighting bull. The max production for this
          car was supposed to be 4000, but the sales went to high,
          and Lamborghini exceeded it to 5000. It is one of the
          most high preformance cars in italy and the United
          States. Lamborghini first designed tractors(that is why
          the logo is a bull). But soon, in 1963, the first
          lamborghini production car was released.
